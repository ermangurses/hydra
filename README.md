Project Desctiprion:
---------------------
Hydra aims at tracking and automatically detecting the amount of water consumed 
by users per day. It does so by using a combination of raw data collected from 
android smart watches and processes them on the users phone. 
The ultimate goal of the project is to prevent users from getting dehydrated.

Our goals are as follows - 

1. Autmatically detect when users start drinking water.
2. Keep track of such activities throughout the day.
3. Provide an estimate of the *amount* of water consumed.
4. Provide statistical information to the users about how much water they have drank
   or how much they need to drink.
5. Remind users to drink water, if they Hydra detects they are unable to meet the daily goal.
